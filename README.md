# Spectral-fit

This a routine to classify the infrared spectrum of low mass stars. The input spectrum is compared to spectral libraries of young objects, i.e., the Luhman+2017 and Montreal Spectral library. Youth is mostly indicated in low-resolution near-IR spectra in the triangular H-band continuum shape, which becomes
less pronounced as one moves from very low(δ) to low(γ) and intermediate-gravity(β) late M- and L-type dwarfs. Other indicators exist also in the J and K bands, such as FeH absorption (McLean et al. 2003) or the K-band slope.

We can choose between two different spectral libraries:

> Montreal Spectral library (Gagne et al. (2015)): 
These objects are members of nearby young moving groups (≤120 Myr), with spectral types in the MLT range and δ, γ and β gravities. We consider only high S/N objects, leaving out those with median uncertainties larger than 5% of the median flux value. These spectra were obtained with several instruments, such as Flamingos − 2 and SpeX. Moreover, we include the near-IR Bonnefoy et al. (2014) VLT/SINFONI library of young dwarfs in the M − L transition (M8.5–L4).
